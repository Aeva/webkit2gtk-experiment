--> The code in this repository is currently broken <--


I'm attempting to use WebKit2GTK+ to write games in C++ that use M.GRL
as a display engine.  Ideally, this means being able to expose C++
functions to the javascript environment.  As best I can tell from the
docs, extensions are the only way to do this.


I'm uploading this in hopes that someone can help me figure out why
what I'm doing doesn't work.  Everything builds ok, but the custom
extension doesn't load, and "myCFunction" is never added to the window
object.


The dependencies needed to build this are:
 - webkit2gtk-4.0
 - gtkmm-3.0


Additionally, the main program opens up "localhost:8000/demos/light"
or similar, but at this point in time it does not matter if you change
it to open another url.


Here is what I've been able to find so far to use as documentation

A simple example using an extension:
 - https://github.com/vain/lariza

A blog post that provides only partial examples:
 - https://blogs.igalia.com/carlosgc/2013/09/10/webkit2gtk-web-process-extensions/

Reference documentation explanation, similar to the blog post:
 - http://webkitgtk.org/reference/webkit2gtk/stable/WebKitWebExtension.html


The Lariza example seems to be broken too ... that or their adblock
extension isn't very good and extensions can't write to stdout?
