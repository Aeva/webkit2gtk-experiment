--> The code in this repository is currently broken <--


I'm attempting to use WebKit2GTK+ to write games in C++ that use M.GRL
as a display engine.  Ideally, this means being able to expose C++
functions to the javascript environment.  As best I can tell from the
docs, extensions are the only way to do this.


I'm uploading this in hopes that someone can help me figure out why
what I'm doing doesn't work.  Everything builds ok, but the custom
extension doesn't load, and "myCFunction" is never added to the window
object.


The dependencies needed to build this are:
 - webkit2gtk-4.0
 - gtkmm-3.0


Additionally, the main program opens up "localhost:8000/demos/light"
or similar, but at this point in time it does not matter if you change
it to open another url.
