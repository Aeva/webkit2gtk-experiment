This project demonstrates embedding a browser in a C++ application via
WebKit2GTK+, and how to expose C functions to the javascript
environment.


Modify test.cpp to have a url of your choice before running the build
script.  If all went well, you'll be able to access
"window.myCFunction" in the javascript console after running the
program.


The dependencies needed to build this are:
 - webkit2gtk-4.0
 - gtkmm-3.0


The main program opens up "localhost:8000/demos/light" or similar, but
at this point in time it does not matter if you change it to open
another url.


Here is what I've been able to find so far to use as documentation

A simple example browser using an extension:

A blog post that provides only partial examples:
 - https://blogs.igalia.com/carlosgc/2013/09/10/webkit2gtk-web-process-extensions/

Reference documentation explanation, similar to the blog post:
 - http://webkitgtk.org/reference/webkit2gtk/stable/WebKitWebExtension.html


Many thanks to Vain, the author of Lariza, for helping me get this
working!
